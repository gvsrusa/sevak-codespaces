# Feature Overview Specification: User Feedback System

## 1. Overview

The User Feedback System is a core feature of the AgriConnect application designed to allow users, primarily small and marginal farmers, to provide their valuable input on the app's usability, content, and overall experience. This system aims to collect textual comments and simple ratings in a straightforward manner, ensuring ease of use for individuals with limited technical skills. The collected feedback will be instrumental for iterative improvement of the AgriConnect platform, aligning with the project's goal of being user-centric and responsive to farmer needs. This system emphasizes simplicity in submission and reliable storage of feedback.

## 2. Goals

*   Enable farmers to easily share their opinions, suggestions, and report issues regarding the AgriConnect app.
*   Collect actionable feedback (comments and ratings) to identify areas for improvement in app usability and content quality.
*   Provide a simple and accessible mechanism for feedback submission, considering users with low digital literacy and intermittent internet connectivity.
*   Ensure feedback is reliably captured and stored for review and analysis by the AgriConnect team.
*   Foster a sense of user involvement and demonstrate that their input is valued for the app's evolution.

## 3. User Stories

*   **U.S. 1:** As a farmer, I want to easily submit my comments about the app's features or any difficulties I encounter, so that my experience can be improved and the app can become more helpful.
*   **U.S. 2:** As a farmer, I want to be able to quickly rate the app's overall usability or specific sections, so that the developers understand what works well and what needs enhancement.
*   **U.S. 3:** As a farmer with limited internet, I want to be able to submit my feedback even when I'm offline, knowing it will be sent when I next connect, so my input isn't lost.
*   **U.S. 4:** As an AgriConnect administrator/developer, I want to collect and review user feedback (comments and ratings) in a structured way, so that I can identify common pain points, understand user satisfaction, and prioritize future development efforts effectively.
*   **U.S. 5:** As a farmer, I want the feedback process to be very simple and not require much typing or complex choices, so I can provide input without frustration.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1: Accessible Feedback Option:** Users can find and access a clearly visible and intuitively named feedback submission option (e.g., "Send Feedback," "Rate App") within the app's main navigation or settings menu.
*   **AC2: Textual Comment Submission:** Users can successfully submit free-form textual comments regarding their experience with the app, its usability, or its content.
*   **AC3: Simple Rating Submission:** Users can submit a simple rating for the app (e.g., a 1-5 star scale, or a qualitative scale like "Poor," "Okay," "Good").
*   **AC4: Secure Feedback Storage:** All submitted feedback (comments and/or ratings) is securely stored in the Supabase PostgreSQL database. Feedback should be linkable to an authenticated user (with consent) or submitted anonymously if preferred/configured. (Ref: PRD Line 33, 45)
*   **AC5: Intuitive and Minimal UI:** The feedback submission interface is extremely simple, requiring minimal steps and data entry, designed for users with low digital literacy. (Ref: PRD Section 5, Line 51, Research Summary)
*   **AC6: Offline Capability:** If the user submits feedback while offline, the app queues the feedback locally and automatically synchronizes it with the server once network connectivity is restored. The user is informed that feedback is queued. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
*   **AC7: Submission Confirmation:** Users receive a clear confirmation message upon successful submission of their feedback (or upon successful queuing if offline).
*   **AC8: Privacy Adherence:** The system handles user data associated with feedback in accordance with privacy policies, ensuring user anonymity if required or chosen. (Ref: PRD Line 47)

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1: Initiate Feedback:** The system shall allow users to initiate a feedback submission process from a designated point in the application.
*   **FR2: Input Textual Feedback:** The system shall provide an interface for users to input textual comments of a reasonable length.
*   **FR3: Input Rating:** The system shall provide an interface for users to select a rating from a predefined simple scale (e.g., stars, simple choices).
*   **FR4: Submit Feedback:** The system shall allow users to submit their entered comment and/or rating.
*   **FR5: Store Feedback:** The system shall store the submitted feedback (text, rating, timestamp, associated user ID if applicable, app version) in the backend database (Supabase). (Ref: PRD Line 33, 34)
*   **FR6: Offline Queuing:** The system shall detect offline status and queue feedback submissions locally if the device is not connected to the internet.
*   **FR7: Automatic Synchronization:** The system shall automatically attempt to send queued offline feedback to the server when network connectivity is re-established.
*   **FR8: (Admin) Feedback Retrieval:** The system (backend/admin panel) shall provide a mechanism for authorized administrators to retrieve and view submitted user feedback. (This is an admin-side requirement supporting the feature's purpose).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Usability:** The feedback submission process must be exceptionally simple, intuitive, and require minimal cognitive load, catering to users with low digital literacy and limited experience with mobile apps. (Ref: PRD Section 5, Line 46, Research Summary)
*   **NFR2: Performance:** Feedback submission should be responsive, with minimal delay, even on low-specification devices and poor network conditions.
*   **NFR3: Reliability:** The system must ensure that submitted feedback is not lost, whether submitted online or offline. Queued feedback must be reliably synced.
*   **NFR4: Accessibility:** The UI for feedback submission must adhere to accessibility best practices, including sufficient font sizes, high contrast, and clear touch targets. (Ref: PRD Line 46)
*   **NFR5: Security:** All feedback data, especially if linked to user identifiers, must be transmitted and stored securely. (Ref: PRD Line 47)
*   **NFR6: Privacy:** User privacy must be respected. If feedback is not anonymous, user consent for associating feedback with their profile should be clear. Options for anonymous feedback should be considered. (Ref: PRD Line 47)
*   **NFR7: Data Integrity:** The system must ensure that feedback data is accurately captured and stored without corruption.
*   **NFR8: Simplicity of Design:** The UI must be uncluttered, avoiding excessive graphics or complex interactions. (Ref: PRD Line 53)

## 7. Scope

### In Scope:

*   A dedicated UI section within the app for users to submit feedback.
*   Ability for users to submit textual comments.
*   Ability for users to provide a simple rating (e.g., 1-5 stars or a simple qualitative scale).
*   Storage of feedback (comment, rating, timestamp, user identifier if authenticated and consented, app version) in the Supabase backend.
*   Basic offline handling: queuing feedback locally when the device is offline and syncing it to the server when connectivity resumes.
*   A simple confirmation message to the user upon successful submission or queuing.

### Out of Scope (for MVP):

*   Categorization or tagging of feedback by users at the time of submission.
*   Direct, in-app responses or chat functionality related to submitted feedback.
*   Public display of user feedback or ratings within the app.
*   Advanced analytics, sentiment analysis, or reporting dashboards for feedback (these would be separate admin-facing tools).
*   Feedback mechanisms for specific items like individual marketplace listings or transporter profiles (focus is on general app usability and content).
*   Gamification, points, or rewards for submitting feedback.
*   Attaching images or other media to feedback.

## 8. Dependencies

*   **User Authentication System (Google Social Login):** Required if feedback is to be linked to authenticated users. (Ref: PRD Line 14, 44)
*   **Database System (Supabase PostgreSQL):** Essential for storing all submitted feedback data. (Ref: PRD Line 34, 45)
*   **Network Connectivity Module:** For detecting online/offline status and managing data synchronization. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
*   **Core Application UI Framework:** To integrate the feedback UI components seamlessly.
*   **App Versioning Information:** To log which version of the app the feedback pertains to.

## 9. High-Level UI/UX Considerations

*   **Entry Point:** A clearly labeled and easily discoverable "Feedback," "Rate Us," or "Help & Feedback" option, likely located in the app's main menu, settings screen, or a persistent, non-intrusive UI element.
*   **Simplicity of Interaction:**
    *   **Rating:** A simple star rating (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) or a set of 3-4 clear emoticons/labels (e.g., "Poor", "Okay", "Good", "Excellent").
    *   **Comments:** A straightforward, adequately sized text input field for comments.
    *   Minimize the number of taps and screens required to submit feedback. (Ref: PRD Line 51)
*   **Language and Clarity:** Use simple, jargon-free language in the local language supported by the app. Icons should be universally understandable. (Ref: PRD Line 46)
*   **Guidance:** Minimal, clear instructions (e.g., "Tell us what you think," "How was your experience?").
*   **Confirmation:** A clear, positive confirmation message after submission (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback!"). If offline, "Feedback saved and will be sent when you're online."
*   **Non-Intrusiveness:** The feedback mechanism should not be overly aggressive (e.g., no constant pop-ups asking for feedback).
*   **Optionality:** All fields (e.g., comment vs. rating) could be optional, allowing users to provide only what they are comfortable with, though encouraging both is good.
*   **Visual Design:** Align with the app's overall simple, clean, and friendly aesthetic. Use high contrast and large, legible fonts. (Ref: PRD Section 5)

## 10. High-Level API Design Notes (Illustrative)

This section provides a conceptual idea of the API interaction. Actual implementation details will be defined during the technical design phase.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/feedback`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Authentication:** Bearer Token (if user is authenticated and feedback is not anonymous).
*   **Request Body (JSON Example):**
    ```json
    {
      "userId": "string_or_null", // User's unique ID from authentication system, null if anonymous
      "rating": "integer_or_null", // e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; null if no rating provided
      "comment": "string_or_null", // User's textual feedback; null if no comment provided
      "appVersion": "string", // e.g., "1.0.2"
      "platform": "string", // e.g., "Android"
      "deviceInfo": { // Optional, for context and debugging
        "osVersion": "string", // e.g., "11"
        "model": "string" // e.g., "Samsung Galaxy M01"
      },
      "submittedAt": "timestamp_iso8601" // Client-side timestamp of submission
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (201 Created):**
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Feedback submitted successfully.",
      "feedbackId": "string" // ID of the created feedback record
    }
    ```
*   **Error Responses:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data (e.g., rating out of range, missing required fields if any).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: If authentication is required and token is missing or invalid.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side issue during processing.
