# Feature Overview Specification: User Authentication & Profile Management

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Feature Name:** User Authentication & Profile Management
**Application:** AgriConnect

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for the User Authentication & Profile Management feature within the AgriConnect application. The primary goal of this feature is to provide a simple, secure, and trustworthy way for small and marginal Indian farmers to register and access the application, and manage basic profile information. Given the target users' limited digital literacy, simplicity and reliance on a familiar system (Google) are paramount. This feature directly supports PRD requirements for Google Social Login (PRD Lines 14, 44), basic farmer profiles (PRD Line 26), and data privacy (PRD Line 47).

## 2. User Stories

*   **US1:** As a farmer, I want to easily register for AgriConnect using my existing Google account so that I don't have to remember another password and the process is quick and familiar.
*   **US2:** As a farmer, I want to log in to AgriConnect securely using my Google account so that my information is protected.
*   **US3:** As a farmer, I want to have a simple profile with my name (automatically fetched from Google) and farm location so that the app can provide relevant local information and services.
*   **US4:** As a farmer, I want my contact information (e.g., email from Google) to be stored privately and not shared with other users so that I can maintain my privacy.
*   **US5:** As a farmer, I want to be able to view my basic profile information (name, farm location) within the app.
*   **US6:** As a farmer, I want to be able to update my farm location if it changes, through a simple interface.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1: Google Registration**
    *   **Given** a new user accesses the AgriConnect app,
    *   **When** they choose to register or sign in,
    *   **Then** they are presented with a "Sign in with Google" option as the sole method.
    *   **And** upon successful authentication with their Google account, a new user account is created in AgriConnect, linking their Google ID.
    *   **And** their name and email address are automatically fetched from their Google profile and stored.
    *   **And** they are prompted to confirm or enter their farm location to complete profile setup.
*   **AC2: Google Login**
    *   **Given** an existing registered user accesses the AgriConnect app,
    *   **When** they choose to sign in,
    *   **Then** they are presented with a "Sign in with Google" option as the sole method.
    *   **And** upon successful authentication with their Google account, they are logged into their AgriConnect account.
*   **AC3: Profile Creation (Initial)**
    *   **Given** a user has successfully registered via Google and provided their farm location,
    *   **Then** a basic user profile is created and stored in the AgriConnect database, containing their name (from Google), email (from Google, private), and farm location (user-provided).
*   **AC4: Profile Data Privacy**
    *   **Given** a user's profile contains their email address (and potentially other contact info collected in the future),
    *   **Then** this contact information is not displayed to any other user within the application.
    *   **And** it is not accessible via any public-facing API or interface not intended for the user themselves.
*   **AC5: View Profile**
    *   **Given** a logged-in user,
    *   **When** they navigate to their profile section within the app,
    *   **Then** they can clearly view their stored name and farm location.
*   **AC6: Update Farm Location**
    *   **Given** a logged-in user is viewing their profile,
    *   **When** they choose to edit their farm location,
    *   **Then** they are provided with a simple interface to update their farm location.
    *   **And** upon submitting the change, the updated farm location is saved to their profile in the database.

## 4. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** The system **shall** exclusively use Google Social Login for user registration.
*   **FR2:** The system **shall** exclusively use Google Social Login for user authentication (login).
*   **FR3:** The system **shall** automatically fetch the user's name and email address from their Google profile upon successful authentication during registration.
*   **FR4:** The system **shall** prompt the user to provide their farm location upon initial registration.
*   **FR5:** The system **shall** create and store a user profile containing the user's Google ID, name, email (private), and farm location.
*   **FR6:** The system **shall** ensure that user email addresses are stored privately and are not visible to other users.
*   **FR7:** The system **shall** allow logged-in users to view their own profile information (name, farm location).
*   **FR8:** The system **shall** allow logged-in users to update their farm location.
*   **FR9:** The system **shall not** provide any alternative registration or login methods (e.g., username/password, other social logins).
*   **FR10:** The system **shall** handle errors gracefully during the Google authentication process (e.g., network issues, Google authentication failure) and provide user-friendly feedback.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1 (Simplicity & Usability):** The registration, login, and profile management processes must be extremely simple, intuitive, and require minimal steps, catering to users with limited digital literacy. (Ref: PRD Sec 5, Research Summary)
*   **NFR2 (Security):** Authentication must be secure, leveraging Google's OAuth 2.0 mechanisms. All user profile data, especially private contact information, must be stored securely in the backend database (Supabase PostgreSQL). (Ref: PRD Line 47)
*   **NFR3 (Privacy):** User contact details (email from Google) must be kept strictly private and never exposed to other users or unauthorized third parties. (Ref: PRD Line 47, Research Summary)
*   **NFR4 (Performance):** Authentication and profile data retrieval/update operations should be responsive, minimizing wait times, even on low-bandwidth connections. (Ref: PRD Sec 3)
*   **NFR5 (Reliability):** The Google Social Login integration must be robust and consistently available.
*   **NFR6 (Accessibility):** UI elements related to authentication and profile management must adhere to accessibility best practices, including clear visual hierarchy, sufficient contrast, and easily tappable targets. (Ref: PRD Line 46)
*   **NFR7 (Data Integrity):** User profile information must be accurately stored and retrieved.

## 6. Scope

### In Scope:
*   User registration exclusively via Google Social Login.
*   User login exclusively via Google Social Login.
*   Automatic fetching of name and email from Google during registration.
*   User input and storage of farm location.
*   Creation and storage of basic farmer profiles: Google ID, Name, Email (private), Farm Location.
*   Allowing users to view their own profile (name, farm location).
*   Allowing users to update their farm location.
*   Basic error handling and user feedback for the authentication process.

### Out of Scope:
*   Traditional username/password based registration or login.
*   Support for any other social login providers (e.g., Facebook, etc.).
*   Password management features (e.g., "Forgot Password," as this is handled by Google).
*   Advanced profile features (e.g., profile pictures, detailed bios, status updates).
*   User-initiated account deactivation or deletion (may be considered for future iterations).
*   Administrative interfaces for user management.
*   Linking multiple Google accounts to a single AgriConnect profile.
*   Session management beyond basic login/logout (e.g., "remember me" for extended periods if not standard with Google SDK).

## 7. Dependencies

*   **D1 (External):** Google OAuth 2.0 Service: For handling the authentication flow. Availability and correct configuration of Google Cloud Project credentials are critical.
*   **D2 (Internal):** Backend User Management Service: Capable of storing user profiles (Google ID, name, email, farm location) in the Supabase PostgreSQL database (Ref: PRD Line 45).
*   **D3 (Technical):** Client-side Google Sign-In SDK: For integration into the Android mobile application.
*   **D4 (Network):** Internet Connectivity: Required for users to authenticate via Google. The app should handle offline scenarios gracefully if authentication tokens expire or are unavailable.

## 8. High-Level UI/UX Considerations

*   **UIUX1 (Login/Registration Screen):** A single, clear screen with a prominent "Sign in with Google" button. Minimal text, using simple language.
*   **UIUX2 (Profile Setup):** After initial Google sign-in, a simple screen to input/confirm farm location. This input method should be straightforward (e.g., text field, possibly with state/district selectors if it simplifies without adding complexity).
*   **UIUX3 (Profile View):** A dedicated section in the app where users can see their name and farm location.
*   **UIUX4 (Edit Profile):** An intuitive way to edit the farm location from the profile view.
*   **UIUX5 (Feedback & Errors):** Clear visual feedback during the authentication process (e.g., loading indicators). User-friendly error messages if login fails (e.g., "Could not connect to Google. Please check your internet connection.").
*   **UIUX6 (Trust & Simplicity):** The design should reinforce trust and be extremely easy to navigate, aligning with the low digital literacy of target users. (Ref: Research Summary)

## 9. API Design Notes (Conceptual)

*   **Endpoint: `POST /auth/google/signin`**
    *   **Request:** Client sends Google ID Token obtained from Google Sign-In SDK.
    *   **Response:** Backend verifies token with Google, creates/retrieves user, stores/updates profile (name, email from token), and returns an AgriConnect session token. If new user, prompts for farm location might be handled client-side before this call, or this API could indicate if farm location is missing.
*   **Endpoint: `GET /profile`**
    *   **Request:** (Authenticated)
    *   **Response:** Returns current user's profile data (name, farm location, non-private info).
*   **Endpoint: `PUT /profile`**
    *   **Request:** (Authenticated) JSON body with fields to update (e.g., `{"farm_location": "New Location"}`).
    *   **Response:** Confirmation of update or error.

*(Note: Specific API endpoint design will be detailed further in the technical design phase. The focus here is on the necessary interactions for this feature.)*
