# Feature Overview Specification: Marketplace (Produce Listing & Browsing)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for the "Marketplace (Produce Listing & Browsing)" feature of the AgriConnect application. This feature aims to provide farmers with a simple platform to list their farm produce for sale and enable users to browse these listings. The design prioritizes simplicity, offline capability, and ease of use for farmers with limited digital literacy, as highlighted in the AgriConnect PRD and initial research findings.

## 2. User Stories

- **US1:** As a farmer, I want to create a listing for my produce (specifying type, quantity, and price) so that I can sell it to interested buyers. (Ref: PRD Line 9, 15)
- **US2:** As a farmer, I want to manage my existing produce listings (e.g., edit quantity/price, delete listing) so that I can keep my offerings up-to-date.
- **US3:** As a user (farmer or other), I want to browse available produce listings from other farmers so that I can find produce I need or understand market availability. (Ref: PRD Line 9, 16)
- **US4:** As a farmer, I want to create new listings and view my own listings even when I am offline, so that I can manage my sales activities regardless of connectivity. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Create Produce Listing** (Corresponds to US1)
- **AC1.1:** Given a farmer is logged in, when they navigate to the "List Your Crop" section, then they are presented with a simple form.
- **AC1.2:** Given the listing creation form, when the farmer enters produce type, quantity (e.g., "50 kg"), and price per unit, then the system validates the inputs.
- **AC1.3:** Given valid inputs are provided, when the farmer submits the form, then the listing is created and associated with their user ID. (Ref: PRD Line 23, 27)
- **AC1.4:** Given the listing is successfully created, then a confirmation message (e.g., "Listing posted") is displayed. (Ref: PRD Line 56)
- **AC1.5:** Given the listing is successfully created, then it becomes visible in the marketplace browse view.

**AC2: Manage Produce Listing** (Corresponds to US2)
- **AC2.1:** Given a farmer is logged in, when they navigate to a "My Listings" section, then they can view all their active produce listings.
- **AC2.2:** Given a farmer is viewing their listings, when they select a listing, then they have options to edit or delete it.
- **AC2.3:** Given a farmer chooses to edit a listing, when they update details (e.g., quantity, price) and save, then the changes are reflected in the marketplace.
- **AC2.4:** Given a farmer chooses to delete a listing, when they confirm deletion, then the listing is removed from the marketplace.

**AC3: Browse Produce Listings** (Corresponds to US3)
- **AC3.1:** Given any user (logged in or anonymous, TBD based on overall app access rules) navigates to the "Marketplace" section, then they can view a list of available produce listings. (Ref: PRD Line 16)
- **AC3.2:** Given the list of produce, each listing clearly displays produce type, quantity, price, and an identifier for the seller (respecting privacy, PRD Line 47).
- **AC3.3:** Given the list of produce, it is presented in a simple, scrollable, and easy-to-read format.

**AC4: Offline Functionality** (Corresponds to US4)
- **AC4.1:** Given a farmer is offline, when they create a new produce listing, then the listing data is saved locally on their device. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
- **AC4.2:** Given an offline-created listing exists locally, when the device regains internet connectivity, then the listing is automatically synced with the server.
- **AC4.3:** Given a farmer is offline, when they navigate to "My Listings", then they can view their own listings that were previously created or synced. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
- **AC4.4:** Given a user is offline, when they navigate to the "Marketplace", then they can view a cached version of recently available produce listings. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)

## 4. Functional Requirements

- **FR1: Listing Creation:** The system shall allow authenticated farmers to create produce listings. Each listing must include produce type, quantity (with units), and price (with currency). (Ref: PRD Line 15, 23)
- **FR2: Listing Management:** The system shall allow authenticated farmers to view, edit (e.g., quantity, price), and delete their own active produce listings.
- **FR3: Listing Browsing:** The system shall allow users to browse all active produce listings. Listings should display key information: produce type, quantity, price, and seller reference. (Ref: PRD Line 16)
- **FR4: User ID Association:** Each produce listing must be associated with the unique User ID of the farmer who created it. (Ref: PRD Line 27)
- **FR5: Offline Listing Creation & Sync:** The system shall allow farmers to create new listings while offline. These listings must be stored locally and automatically synchronized with the server when an internet connection becomes available. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
- **FR6: Offline Viewing (Own Listings):** The system shall cache a farmer's own produce listings on their device to allow viewing when offline. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
- **FR7: Offline Viewing (Browse Listings):** The system shall cache a subset of general marketplace listings on the user's device to allow browsing when offline. The recency and scope of this cache to be defined. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Usability (Simplicity & Clarity):** The user interface for creating, managing, and browsing listings must be extremely simple, intuitive, and uncluttered, using clear language, large text, and high-contrast elements. Navigation must be straightforward. (Ref: PRD Line 37, 38, 53, Research Summary)
- **NFR2: Performance:** The feature must be responsive, with minimal loading times, especially on low-bandwidth connections. Offline operations should feel seamless.
- **NFR3: Reliability & Data Integrity:** All listing data must be stored accurately. The offline synchronization mechanism must be robust, preventing data loss or corruption. (Ref: Research Summary)
- **NFR4: Offline Capability:** Core marketplace functions (creating/viewing own listings, browsing cached listings) must be fully operational offline. (Ref: PRD Line 35, 41)
- **NFR5: Security:** User authentication (via Google Social Login) is mandatory before creating/managing listings. Seller information displayed in listings must adhere to privacy guidelines (PRD Line 47).
- **NFR6: Accessibility:** The design must cater to users with limited digital literacy, incorporating intuitive icons and simple workflows. (Ref: PRD Line 46)
- **NFR7: Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and listings without significant degradation in performance (relevant for backend).
