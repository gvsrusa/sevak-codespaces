**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-12
**Author:** Roo, Spec Writer AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the feature overview specification for the **Agricultural Advisory Services** within the AgriConnect application. This feature aims to empower small and marginal Indian farmers by providing them with accessible, practical, and localized advice on crop management and post-harvest practices. The goal is to help farmers improve yields, reduce losses, and make informed decisions.

This feature comprises two main sub-components:
*   **Crop Advisory:** Providing concise tips on common pests, diseases, and climate-related farming advice.
*   **Post-Harvest Practices:** Offering guidance on handling and storing harvests to minimize losses.

This specification is based on the AgriConnect PRD ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)), particularly Sections 3, 4, 5, and 7, and incorporates insights from the initial research phase, emphasizing content relevance, trust, localization, and offline access.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope
*   Displaying pre-defined crop advisory information (covering common pests, diseases, and climate-related advice for key local crops).
*   Displaying pre-defined post-harvest handling and storage guidance (articles, checklists).
*   Local caching of all advisory content (text and images) for offline access.
*   Synchronization of advisory content when online.
*   Support for multiple local languages (as defined by the application) for content display.
*   A simple, clean, and intuitive user interface for browsing and reading advisory content.
*   Content to include text and images where appropriate and beneficial.

### 6.2. Out of Scope
*   User-generated advisory content, comments, ratings, or forums within the advisory section.
*   Real-time chat or direct consultation with agricultural experts through this feature.
*   Advanced AI-driven diagnostic tools (e.g., image-based pest/disease identification via user uploads) (Ref: PRD line 50).
*   Highly personalized advisory based on individual farm data, soil tests, or specific user inputs beyond general regional relevance.
*   Content creation, translation, or management tools (this feature is a consumer of prepared content).
*   Push notifications for new or updated advisory content (this may be a general app feature handled elsewhere).
*   Video or audio content for advisories in this iteration.

## 7. Dependencies

*   **D1: User Authentication System:** Relies on the app's Google Social Login for user identification (Ref: PRD line 14, 44), though not strictly for content access, it might be used for future personalization or tracking content relevance.
*   **D2: Global Language Selection System:** Depends on an application-wide setting that allows users to select their preferred language, which this feature will honor.
*   **D3: Content Management & Sourcing:** Critically dependent on an external process or system for creating, curating, localizing (translating), and updating trustworthy agricultural advisory content. This includes text and image assets (Research Highlight; PRD line 29, 30).
*   **D4: Core Application Framework:** For UI rendering, navigation services, local database/caching mechanisms, and network connectivity management.
*   **D5: Cloud Database (Supabase PostgreSQL):** The master source for all advisory content that is synced to the client applications (Ref: PRD line 34, 45).

## 8. High-Level UI/UX Considerations

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Clear, distinct entry points from the main application menu/dashboard (e.g., "Crop Tips," "Harvest Care").
    *   Intuitive, possibly hierarchical browsing (e.g., Crop Advisory -> [Crop Name] -> [Pest/Disease/Climate] -> [Specific Tip]).
    *   Easy-to-understand categorization for post-harvest tips.
*   **Content Display:**
    *   Large, legible fonts and high-contrast text for readability (Ref: PRD line 37).
    *   Use of simple, universally understood icons to supplement text and aid navigation, especially for low-literacy users (Ref: PRD line 46).
    *   Images should be clear, relevant, and optimized for mobile viewing and low bandwidth. They should support the textual information.
    *   Content pages should be uncluttered, focusing on the advisory information.
*   **Offline Experience:**
    *   Clear visual indication if the user is viewing offline (cached) content.
    *   Graceful handling if specific, non-cached content is accessed offline (though the goal is full caching).
*   **Language:**
    *   Content should render correctly and completely in the selected local language.
*   **Simplicity & Tone:**
    *   Adhere to the overall app's "simple, clean, and friendly" style with a "modest farm-friendly vibe" (Ref: PRD line 37).
    *   Avoid technical jargon where possible; use language easily understood by farmers.

## 9. API Design Notes (Conceptual)

While much of the interaction will be with local cache, an API will be needed for initial fetch and subsequent synchronization of advisory content.

*   **Endpoint for fetching/syncing all advisory content:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/advisory/all?lang={language_code}&last_sync_timestamp={timestamp}`
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `language_code`: e.g., "hi", "mr", "en". To fetch content for the specified language.
        *   `last_sync_timestamp` (optional): If provided, returns only content updated since this timestamp. If omitted, returns all content.
    *   **Response:** A JSON object containing structured data for both crop advisory and post-harvest practices, versioned for updates.

*   **Example JSON Structure (Simplified):**
    ```json
    {
      "schema_version": "1.0",
      "content_version": "20250512080000", // Timestamp or version string
      "language": "hi",
      "crop_advisory": [
        {
          "id": "crop_tomato_pest_aphids",
          "crop_name": "टमाटर",
          "category": "कीट (Pest)",
          "title": "एफिड्स नियंत्रण",
          "summary": "एफिड्स के प्रकोप को कैसे पहचानें और नियंत्रित करें...",
          "details_text": "विस्तृत जानकारी...",
          "image_url": "cdn.agriconnect.com/images/tomato_aphids_hi.jpg",
          "last_updated": "20250510120000"
        }
        // ... more crop advisory items
      ],
      "post_harvest_practices": [
        {
          "id": "postharvest_grains_storage",
          "category": "अनाज (Grains)",
          "title": "अनाज के लिए भंडारण युक्तियाँ",
          "summary": "फसल कटाई के बाद अनाज को सुरक्षित कैसे रखें...",
          "details_text": "विस्तृत लेख या चेकलिस्ट आइटम...",
          "image_url": "cdn.agriconnect.com/images/grain_storage_hi.jpg",
          "last_updated": "20250511100000"
        }
        // ... more post-harvest items
      ]
    }
    ```
    *   Each item should include unique IDs, localized text fields, image URLs, and update timestamps.
    *   The structure should allow for easy parsing and storage in the local cache.

This conceptual API design supports fetching localized content and incremental updates, which are key for offline functionality and efficient data usage.
