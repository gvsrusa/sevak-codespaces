AgriConnect SPARC Blueprint
Section 1: The Big Picture – What is this program all about?
Elevator Pitch: AgriConnect is a mobile app that empowers small and marginal Indian farmers with essential tools and information. It offers a basic marketplace for listing farm produce and discovering local market prices, combined with practical crop advisory tips, post-harvest storage guidance, and simple transport connections. All features are designed to be lightweight, accessible (low bandwidth, local languages), and user-friendly for farmers with limited tech skills.
Problem Solver: AgriConnect tackles critical agricultural challenges. It addresses volatile crop prices by letting farmers list their produce and view real-time local commodity prices, enabling more informed selling decisions. It solves information gaps by providing concise, actionable guidance on pests, diseases, and climate impacts (for example, dealing with heat stress or saving water). It also helps reduce post-harvest losses by giving farmers best-practice advice on storage and handling of produce.
Why It Needs to Exist: This app directly benefits farmers’ livelihoods by saving time and money. By bringing price transparency and an easy selling platform, it lowers marketing costs and prevents distress sales. By delivering free expert advice tailored to local crops and conditions, it improves yields and helps farmers adapt to climate change. By educating farmers on proper storage, it prevents spoilage and waste. In short, AgriConnect makes market access and agronomy guidance accessible to those who need it.
Section 2: The Users – Who is this program for?
Primary Users: The main users are small and marginal farmers in India, especially those with limited education, digital literacy, or internet access. The app is also suitable for rural farm advisors or extension workers serving these communities, but the core audience is individual farmers.
User Goals: When using AgriConnect, farmers will want to:
Sell crops effectively: Easily list their produce for sale and find local buyers at fair prices, aided by up-to-date market rates.
Access expert advice: Quickly get practical answers to common problems (crop pests, diseases, weather impacts) to protect and improve their yields.
Manage harvest and transport: Learn how to store and handle their harvest to avoid losses, and connect with nearby transporters to move goods to market.
Section 3: The Features – What can the program do?
Core Actions: Users of AgriConnect can perform actions including:
Sign up / Log in: Register or log in using Google Social Login.
Create and manage listings: Enter details of a crop (type, quantity, price) to list produce for sale in the marketplace.
Browse the marketplace: View available produce listings posted by other farmers.
Check market prices: Look up real-time, local commodity prices for key crops.
Access crop advisory: Read concise tips on common pests, diseases, and climate-related farming advice.
Learn post-harvest practices: Read guidance on handling and storing harvests to reduce losses.
Request transportation: Post a request for help transporting a harvest to market.
Browse transporters: View a list of nearby transporters and their contact details.
Provide feedback: Submit comments or ratings on the app’s usability and content.
Key Feature Deep Dive (Marketplace & Price Discovery): For example, when a farmer wants to sell a crop, they open the app and tap “Marketplace.” They then tap “List Your Crop” and see a simple form with fields for Crop Type, Quantity, and Desired Price. The farmer selects the crop, enters the quantity (e.g. “50 kg”), types in the price per unit, and taps Submit. The app confirms that the listing is live. Back in the marketplace view, the new listing appears (highlighted at the top) showing the crop, quantity, and price. If the farmer then opens the Market Prices section, they choose a crop (e.g. “Wheat”) and a nearby market location. The app then displays the latest price for that crop in that market (for example, ₹X per quintal). The farmer uses this information to decide whether to adjust their offer or proceed with a sale. This flow is designed to be fast and clear even on low-bandwidth connections.
Section 4: The Information – What does it need to handle?
Information Needed: The app must handle and store:
Farmer profiles: Basic user info (linked via Google), including name, contact, and farm location.
Produce listings: For each listing: crop type, quantity, price, and a reference to the seller (user ID).
Price data: Real-time market prices for key commodities (fetched from external sources or database).
Crop advisory content: Text/images for pest/disease tips and weather/climate guidance for crops.
Post-harvest guidance: Articles or checklists on storage methods and spoilage prevention.
Transporters: Details of available transport providers (name, capacity, contact info, service areas).
Transport requests: Posted requests by farmers for transport (type of produce, date, pickup location).
User feedback: Textual feedback or ratings from farmers about the app.
This data will be stored in a cloud database (Supabase PostgreSQL) and cached as needed on the device.
Offline Functionality: Yes. The app should work with intermittent connectivity. Core information (such as saved listings, price data, and advisory content) will be cached locally so that users can still view information and use the app even when they have no internet connection. Any new listings or requests made offline will synchronize once a connection is re-established.
Section 5: Look & Feel – How should it generally seem?
Overall Style: The app should feel simple, clean, and friendly. Use a clear, uncluttered design with large, high-contrast text and buttons to aid usability. Icons and color accents (for example, green and earth tones) should give a modest farm-friendly vibe without overwhelming graphics. Overall, the tone is informal and accessible, not technical or formal, so farmers feel comfortable using it.
Similar Programs (Appearance): We admire interfaces that are intuitive and uncluttered. For instance, KhetiBuddy’s mobile app and other basic agri apps have straightforward, text-and-icon layouts that are easy to navigate. The Hesa platform emphasizes a mobile-first, easy-to-use design, which we would emulate. In contrast, we want to avoid cluttered e-commerce style screens (like a busy online store) and focus on readability and simplicity.
Section 6: The Platform – Where will it be used?
Primary Environment: AgriConnect is primarily a mobile application. The main platform is Android smartphones (which are most common among rural users), with the user interface optimized for phones and tablets. We may consider an iOS version for completeness, but the focus is on Android. There is no need for a desktop or web version in the MVP.
Offline Use: Yes. The app should be designed to work offline or with intermittent connectivity. Critical content (like saved listings, advisories, and last-fetched prices) will be cached locally so that farmers can still view and use it even when they have no internet connection. Any new listings or transport requests made offline will synchronize when connectivity returns.
Section 7: Rules & Boundaries – What are the non-negotiables?
Must-Have Rules:
All users must register using Google Social Login for authentication (no separate sign-up form).
The database must be Supabase (cloud PostgreSQL) as specified, and all information (listings, prices, user data, etc.) should be stored there securely.
The app must be accessible to low-literacy and low-tech users: use minimal text, intuitive icons, and offer local language support (Hindi, Marathi, etc.).
Privacy is critical: user contact details and personal data must be kept private and never exposed to other users.
Things to Avoid:
No full transaction or payment processing in-app: do not charge money or handle e-commerce transactions in this MVP.
Do not build complex AI features (like image-based diagnosis or advanced analytics) or integrate warehousing logistics or financing schemes in the MVP.
Avoid requiring users to input excessive data (forms should be very simple).
The app should not send unsolicited notifications or share data with third parties without consent.
Avoid cluttered layouts or excessive graphics; keep the UI focused on the core tasks above.
Section 8: Success Criteria – How do we know it's perfect?
Definition of Done (Example Scenarios): The app will meet success criteria if it handles these cases smoothly:
Listing a Crop: When a farmer logs in with Google and creates a produce listing (by entering crop, quantity, price), the app immediately shows a confirmation (e.g. “Listing posted”) and displays the new listing in the marketplace feed. All fields should save correctly in the database.
Viewing Prices: When a farmer navigates to the Market Prices section, selects a crop (e.g. “Wheat”) and a nearby market, the app should fetch and display the latest local price (e.g. “₹X per unit”) accurately. If the price data is outdated, it should indicate when it was last updated.
Accessing Crop Advisory: When a farmer opens an advisory entry (for example, “Cotton – Pest Management”), the app should display the correct text guidance and images (if any) related to that topic. The information should be easy to read and in the selected language.

Cluttered or commerce-heavy layouts (e.g. large online shops) are unfriendly to novices.
Lack of local language or voice interfaces in many apps limits accessibility.
Financial/transactional focus or forced purchases in some platforms (to be avoided in our MVP).
Section 10: Future Dreams (Optional)
Nice-to-Haves: Potential long-term features that could be added after the MVP:
In-app transactions: Secure payment gateway for direct sales, digital wallets, or linking to payments/banking.
Financial services: Integrated microcredit, insurance products, savings schemes for farmers.
Advanced Advisory: AI-driven chatbots or image recognition (e.g. photo of a plant to diagnose disease).
Mechanization Marketplace: Ability to find/rent farm machinery and labor on-demand.
Warehousing & Cold Storage: Listings for nearby storage facilities or cooperative warehouses.
Expanded Logistics: Real-time transport booking and tracking (GPS-enabled).
