# AgriConnect - Framework Scaffolding Report

Date: 2025-05-12

## 1. Overview

This report summarizes the framework scaffolding activities performed for the AgriConnect project. The objective was to establish the foundational structure, DevOps practices, boilerplate code, and initial test harness based on the Master Project Plan. This prepares the project for feature-specific development.

## 2. Master Project Plan (MPP)

*   **Initial Creation:** The [`docs/Master_Project_Plan.md`](../../docs/Master_Project_Plan.md) was initially created by `@docs-writer-feature` using pre-formulated content (signal `b8c9d0e1-f2a3-4567-8901-234567123456`).
*   **Detailed Expansion:** The MPP was subsequently expanded by `@architect-highlevel-module` to include:
    *   **Technology Stack:** Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Room) for frontend; Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions) for backend.
    *   **Key Features:** User Authentication, Marketplace, Market Price Discovery, Agricultural Advisory, Transportation Logistics, User Feedback.
    *   **Project Directory Structure:** Defined for `AgriConnect/`, including `android_app/` and `supabase/`.
    *   **Development Branch:** `main`.

## 3. DevOps Foundations Setup

Performed by `@DevOps_Foundations_Setup`:

*   **Project Directory:** The root project directory [`AgriConnect/`](../../AgriConnect/) was created within the workspace.
*   **Version Control:** A Git repository was initialized in [`AgriConnect/`](../../AgriConnect/).
*   **`.gitignore`:** A project-specific [`.gitignore`](../../AgriConnect/.gitignore) file was configured for Android (Kotlin/Gradle) and Supabase (Node.js) artifacts.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** A basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions was set up, defined in [`AgriConnect/.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../AgriConnect/.github/workflows/ci.yml). It triggers on pushes/PRs to `main` and includes environment setup for Android and Node.js, with placeholders for build/test steps (later updated by the Tester).
*   **Branching:** The `main` branch was confirmed as the primary development branch.

## 4. Framework Boilerplate Generation

Performed by `@Coder_Framework_Boilerplate` (in two stages):

### 4.1. Android Application (`AgriConnect/android_app/`)

*   **Project Setup:** New Android Studio project (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose).
*   **Gradle:** Configured project-level (`build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`) and module-level (`app/build.gradle.kts`) files with necessary dependencies (Compose, Lifecycle, Room, Coroutines, Navigation, Hilt).
*   **Core Files:** `AndroidManifest.xml`, Hilt-enabled `AgriConnectApplication.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`.
*   **Resources & Theming:** Initial `colors.xml`, `strings.xml`, `themes.xml` (day/night), Jetpack Compose `Theme.kt`, `Color.kt`, `Typography.kt`, `Shape.kt`, `dimens.xml`, `data_extraction_rules.xml`, `backup_rules.xml`.
*   **MVVM Structure:**
    *   `core/`: `Utils.kt`.
    *   `data/`: `AppDatabase.kt` (Room), placeholder models and DAOs for all features.
    *   `domain/`: Base `UseCase.kt`.
    *   `ui/`: Placeholder ViewModels and Composable Screens for Auth, Marketplace, Prices, Advisory, Transport, and Feedback features.

### 4.2. Supabase Backend (`AgriConnect/supabase/`)

*   **Configuration:** [`config.toml`](../../AgriConnect/supabase/config.toml) created.
*   **Database Migration:** Initial schema migration [`20250512034932_initial_schema.sql`](../../AgriConnect/supabase/migrations/20250512034932_initial_schema.sql) created, defining tables for `profiles`, `produce_listings`, `market_prices`, `advisory_content`, `transport_requests`, `feedback_submissions` with relationships and basic RLS.
*   **Edge Function:** Placeholder function created at [`functions/user-profile-init/index.ts`](../../AgriConnect/supabase/functions/user-profile-init/index.ts).

### 4.3. Root Project Files

*   **README:** [`AgriConnect/README.md`](../../AgriConnect/README.md) created with project description and setup instructions for Android and Supabase.

## 5. Test Harness Setup

Performed by `@Tester_TDD_Master`:

### 5.1. Android (`AgriConnect/android_app/`)

*   **Dependencies & Runner:** Verified and updated `app/build.gradle.kts` with Mockito and Hilt testing dependencies. Test runner confirmed.
*   **Unit Tests:** Placeholder stubs created in `app/src/test/java/com/agriconnect/` (e.g., [`AuthViewModelTest.kt`](../../AgriConnect/android_app/app/src/test/java/com/agriconnect/AuthViewModelTest.kt), [`MarketplaceViewModelTest.kt`](../../AgriConnect/android_app/app/src/test/java/com/agriconnect/MarketplaceViewModelTest.kt), [`AdvisoryRepositoryTest.kt`](../../AgriConnect/android_app/app/src/test/java/com/agriconnect/AdvisoryRepositoryTest.kt)).
*   **Instrumentation Tests:** Placeholder stubs created in `app/src/androidTest/java/com/agriconnect/` (e.g., [`LoginScreenTest.kt`](../../AgriConnect/android_app/app/src/androidTest/java/com/agriconnect/LoginScreenTest.kt), [`ProduceListingDaoTest.kt`](../../AgriConnect/android_app/app/src/androidTest/java/com/agriconnect/ProduceListingDaoTest.kt)).

### 5.2. Supabase (`AgriConnect/supabase/`)

*   **Edge Function Test:** Basic test stub for `user-profile-init` function created at [`functions/user-profile-init/index.test.ts`](../../AgriConnect/supabase/functions/user-profile-init/index.test.ts) using Deno's test framework.

### 5.3. CI Pipeline Update

*   The [`AgriConnect/.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../AgriConnect/.github/workflows/ci.yml) was updated to execute Android unit tests and Supabase Edge Function tests. A placeholder for Android instrumentation tests was included.

## 6. Initial Project Structure (`AgriConnect/`)

The scaffolding process resulted in the following primary top-level structure within the `AgriConnect/` project directory:
*   `android_app/`: Contains the Android application code and resources.
*   `supabase/`: Contains Supabase backend configurations, migrations, and edge functions.
*   `.github/`: Contains GitHub Actions CI workflow.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files for Git.
*   `README.md`: Provides an overview and setup instructions for the project.

The `docs/` directory at the workspace root contains planning documents like `Master_Project_Plan.md` and this `Framework_Scaffold_Report.md`.

## 7. Conclusion

The framework scaffolding for the AgriConnect project is complete. The project now has a defined structure, version control, basic CI, boilerplate code for frontend and backend, and an initial test harness. It is now ready for detailed feature development and test implementation.
