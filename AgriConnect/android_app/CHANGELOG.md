# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Generated Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`) to ensure consistent and reliable builds for the Android application. This resolves previous environment setup issues related to Gradle versioning (Change Request: `a0b1c2d3-e4f5-6789-0123-abcdef987654`).
