# Knowledge Gaps

This document outlines unanswered questions, areas needing deeper exploration, and current blockers in the research process.

## Current Major Knowledge Gaps & Blockers:

1.  **Perplexity AI Connectivity Issues:**
    *   **Description:** Multiple attempts to use the Perplexity AI MCP tool (`perplexity-ask` server, `perplexity_research` tool) have resulted in timeout errors. This has occurred even with simplified queries.
    *   **Impact:** This is a critical blocker for the "Initial Data Collection" phase. Without successful queries to Perplexity AI, primary and secondary research findings cannot be gathered for the remaining key questions, specifically:
        *   Detailed aspects of PRD content best practices (beyond the initial successful query on good requirements/user stories).
        *   Requirements elicitation methodologies.
        *   Recommendations for a PRD outline for `docs/PRD.md`.
    *   **Next Steps (if blocker persists):** Alternative research methods or tools would need to be considered. If Perplexity AI remains unavailable, the research cannot proceed as planned.

2.  **Incomplete Primary Data Collection:**
    *   **Description:** Due to the Perplexity AI issue, only two primary research queries have been successfully executed and their results documented in:
        *   `research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part1.md`
        *   `research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`
    *   **Impact:** The breadth and depth of information required to comprehensively address the research objectives are currently insufficient.

3.  **Secondary Findings and Expert Insights Not Yet Researched:**
    *   **Description:** The `02_secondary_findings.md` and `03_expert_insights.md` files in the `research/02_data_collection` directory have not been created or populated as this stage relies on successful Perplexity AI queries.
    *   **Impact:** Lack of broader contextual information and expert opinions weakens the overall research.

## Unanswered Questions (Pending Successful Data Collection):

*   What are the most effective techniques for eliciting requirements from various stakeholders (e.g., business owners, users, technical teams)? (Beyond the initial query attempt)
    *   How can these techniques be combined or sequenced for optimal results?
    *   What specific questions or topic areas should be covered during requirements elicitation?
    *   How can conflicting requirements from different stakeholders be identified and resolved?
    *   What is the role of a product manager or business analyst in the elicitation process?
    *   How can requirements be prioritized effectively?
*   Based on all findings, what is a recommended, detailed, Markdown-compatible table of contents/outline for the `docs/PRD.md` file?
    *   How can this outline be structured to be flexible yet comprehensive?
    *   What placeholders or prompts can be included in the outline?
*   Further details on balancing PRD comprehensiveness with usability.
*   Further details on the role and integration of visual information in PRDs.
*   Further details on version control and change management for PRDs.
*   Further details on common mistakes in PRD content writing and avoidance strategies.
