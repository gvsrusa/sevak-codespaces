# Knowledge Gaps: AgriConnect Feasibility Study & Market Analysis

This document identifies unanswered questions, areas requiring deeper exploration, and information gaps that have emerged from the initial data collection and analysis phases of the AgriConnect feasibility study. This list will drive targeted research in subsequent cycles.

**Format for each knowledge gap:**
*   **Gap ID:** (e.g., KG-001)
*   **Description:** (A clear statement of the knowledge gap)
*   **Source/Reason:** (Why this is considered a gap, e.g., insufficient detail in primary findings, conflicting information, new question arising from analysis, PRD ambiguity)
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** (A specific, targeted query for Perplexity AI to address this gap)
*   **Status:** (e.g., Open, In Progress, Addressed in Part X of Primary Findings)

**KG-001**
*   **Description:** Specific, actionable strategies for Supabase (PostgreSQL) schema design and data synchronization mechanisms optimized for frequent offline access and low-bandwidth conditions for an app like AgriConnect. While general offline strategies were discussed, Supabase-specific best practices for this scenario are not detailed.
*   **Source/Reason:** Primary findings on technological considerations ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md) - Section 3.1, 3.4) mention Supabase and offline needs, but lack specific implementation details for this combination.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "What are best practices for designing a PostgreSQL schema with Supabase for a mobile app requiring robust offline capabilities and efficient data synchronization over low-bandwidth networks, targeting Indian agricultural users? Discuss table structures, conflict resolution strategies, and sync optimization techniques. Cite examples or Supabase documentation."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-002**
*   **Description:** Detailed breakdown of the typical data volumes generated by core AgriConnect features (e.g., daily market price updates for multiple crops/mandis, localized weather data, user-generated queries, advisory content) and the associated storage/bandwidth implications for both the device and Supabase backend, especially concerning cost for small farmers if data charges apply.
*   **Source/Reason:** While low-bandwidth is a requirement ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md) - Section 3.2), the actual data footprint of key features is not quantified. This impacts technology choices and potential user costs.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "Estimate typical daily/monthly data usage (device storage and network bandwidth) for a small Indian farmer using an agritech app with features like localized market prices, weather alerts, image-based pest diagnosis, and short voice/text advisory. Provide data ranges and discuss implications for Supabase backend load and costs. Cite relevant studies or benchmarks."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-003**
*   **Description:** Comparative analysis of the *actual, on-the-ground effectiveness* and *farmer adoption rates* of different local language support mechanisms (e.g., text translation vs. voice-based UI vs. transliteration) specifically within the Indian agritech app context.
*   **Source/Reason:** Local language support is crucial ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part2.md) - Section 3.3), but the relative success of different approaches among low-literacy users is not deeply explored.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "What is the comparative effectiveness and user adoption of different local language implementation strategies (e.g., full UI translation, voice-only interaction, transliterated text, AI-powered multilingual chat) in mobile apps for Indian farmers with varying literacy levels? Provide case studies or research findings. Cite sources."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-004**
*   **Description:** Specific, proven mechanisms for *validating community-sourced data* (e.g., local market prices reported by farmers, pest sightings) to ensure accuracy before wider dissemination within an app like AgriConnect.
*   **Source/Reason:** Data acquisition for market prices is a challenge ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md) - Section 4.1), and community sourcing is a potential solution, but validation is key. Content relevance strategies mention expert validation but not specifically for dynamic, community-sourced data ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md) - Section 4.3).
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "What are effective and scalable mechanisms for validating community-sourced agricultural data (e.g., local market prices, pest reports) submitted by farmers via a mobile app in India? Discuss algorithmic approaches, peer-review systems, and integration with expert verification. Cite examples from existing platforms."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-005**
*   **Description:** Detailed monetization models successfully employed by *competitors specifically targeting small and marginal Indian farmers* with similar demographic profiles to AgriConnect's target, beyond generic mentions of freemium or commissions. What are the price points, conversion rates, and farmer perceptions of these models?
*   **Source/Reason:** Contradiction identified regarding "free" service expectation vs. sustainable monetization ([`research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md`](research/03_analysis/02_contradictions.md) - Contradiction 3). The PRD lacks detail on AgriConnect's monetization strategy. Primary findings on competitors ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md) - Section 2.1) list features but not always detailed monetization specifics for this exact segment.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "Provide a detailed analysis of monetization strategies (including specific price points, services offered, and reported farmer uptake/perception) used by agritech apps like BharatAgri, KhetiBuddy, or Hesa that primarily target small and marginal Indian farmers. What models have shown promise for sustainability without alienating low-income users? Cite sources."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-006**
*   **Description:** Specific examples and effectiveness of *gamification techniques* or non-monetary incentives that have successfully driven sustained engagement and learning among low-literacy adult users in rural India, applicable to an agricultural context.
*   **Source/Reason:** User onboarding findings mention gamification ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings_part3.md) - Section 4.2), but concrete, culturally relevant examples for this demographic are sparse.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "What are specific examples of gamification mechanics or non-monetary incentives that have proven effective in promoting sustained user engagement and learning in mobile applications targeting low-literacy adult users in rural India, particularly in agricultural or vocational training contexts? Cite case studies or research."
*   **Status:** Open

**KG-007**
*   **Description:** Deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of *Hesa* and *GetFarms*, as these were mentioned in the PRD (Section 9) but had less detailed information available in the initial competitor analysis query compared to others like BharatAgri or Cropin.
*   **Source/Reason:** Initial competitor analysis ([`research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md`](research/02_data_collection/01_primary_findings.md) - Section 2) provided more detail on some competitors than others listed in the PRD.
*   **Potential Query for Next Cycle:** "Provide a detailed competitive analysis of Indian agritech platforms Hesa and GetFarms, focusing on their target user segment (small/marginal farmers), key features relevant to AgriConnect's goals (offline, local language, advisory, market linkage), business model, reported strengths, and weaknesses. Cite recent reports or official sources."
*   **Status:** Open
