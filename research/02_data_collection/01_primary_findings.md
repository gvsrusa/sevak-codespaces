        *   **Logistics**: Pickup/delivery options, packaging requirements, and perishability indicators (e.g., shelf life for fruits/vegetables)[2].
        *   **Visual documentation**: Uploading photos of produce to establish authenticity and attract buyers[5].
        *   **Location details**: Village/taluk-level geotagging to connect with nearby buyers and reduce transport costs[2][5].
        For example, apps like those tested in academic studies use Firebase databases to let farmers input these details through simplified forms, with dropdown menus for crop types and quality parameters[5].

        **2. Importance of Real-Time Local Market Price Information:**
        **Real-time pricing is critical** for informed decision-making:
        *   **Granularity**: Prices at the **specific local market** level (e.g., mandi or village cluster) are more actionable than district-level averages, as rates can vary significantly within short distances[4][5].
        *   **Frequency**: Hourly or daily updates help farmers avoid underselling during price dips. A study highlighted apps that use APIs to pull data from government mandi portals, displaying trends over 7–30 days[4][5].
        *   **Bulk pricing insights**: Apps reducing broker margins by showing bulk-order discounts (e.g., 10% lower per kg for 100+ kg orders) enable farmers to negotiate better deals[2].
        For instance, the Flutter-based app in [2] integrates real-time price dashboards, allowing farmers to compare offers from multiple buyers before listing.

        **3. Expectations and Concerns About Finding Local Buyers:**
        **Expectations**:
        *   **Direct buyer access**: Eliminating intermediaries to secure 15–30% higher margins, as seen in pilot projects[2][5].
        *   **Transparent transactions**: Features like buyer ratings, transaction histories, and in-app dispute resolution[5].
        *   **Multilingual support**: Apps in regional languages (e.g., Tamil, Marathi) to reduce literacy barriers[1][4].
        **Concerns**:
        *   **Payment security**: Fear of fraud drives demand for escrow systems or UPI-linked payments, as implemented in Firebase-backed apps[5].
        *   **Tech literacy**: Anxiety about navigating complex interfaces; solutions include voice-guided tutorials and community help desks[4].
