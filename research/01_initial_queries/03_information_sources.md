# Information Sources: AgriConnect Feasibility Study & Market Analysis

This document outlines the potential sources of information that will be consulted during the AgriConnect feasibility study and market analysis.

## 1. Primary Internal Source

-   **AgriConnect Product Requirements Document (PRD):** ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md))
    -   This document is the foundational source for understanding the project's goals, target users (Section 2), proposed features (Section 3), technical constraints (Section 7), and success criteria (Section 8). It will be referenced extensively throughout the research.

## 2. Primary External Research Tool

-   **Perplexity AI (via MCP Tool):**
    -   This will be the main tool for conducting external research. Queries will be formulated based on the Key Research Questions document ([`research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md`](research/01_initial_queries/02_key_questions.md)).
    -   **Usage Focus:**
        -   Gathering information on the needs and challenges of small and marginal Indian farmers.
        -   Analyzing competitor applications (BharatAgri, Cropin, KhetiBuddy, Farmonaut, Fasal, Hesa, GetFarms â€“ as per PRD Section 9) including their features, strengths, weaknesses, user reviews, and technology stacks if available.
        -   Investigating appropriate technologies for Android development, offline functionality, low-bandwidth optimization, local language support, and Supabase integration.
        -   Identifying common challenges and risks in developing and deploying agri-tech MVPs in India.
        -   Finding reports, articles, and studies on agri-tech adoption, digital literacy, and internet penetration in rural India.
        -   Sourcing information on best practices for UI/UX design for low-literacy users.
        -   Exploring methods for acquiring and maintaining agricultural data (market prices, advisory content).

## 3. Secondary Information Sources (to be identified via Perplexity AI and general search)

### 3.1. Competitor Information:
    -   Official websites of competitor applications.
    -   App store listings (Google Play Store) for user reviews, download statistics (if public), and feature descriptions.
    -   News articles, blog posts, and industry reports discussing these competitor apps.
    -   Case studies or white papers published by these companies (if available).

### 3.2. Agri-Tech Industry Reports & Publications:
    -   Reports from market research firms (e.g., NASSCOM, FICCI, Bain & Company, McKinsey) on the Indian agri-tech sector.
    -   Publications from agricultural organizations, government bodies (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare), and NGOs working with farmers in India.
    -   Academic research papers and journals focusing on agricultural technology, rural development, and farmer behavior in India.

### 3.3. Technology Documentation & Communities:
    -   Official documentation for Android development, Supabase, PostgreSQL.
    -   Developer forums and communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions) for insights into technical challenges and solutions related to offline sync, low-bandwidth optimization, and multi-language support.
    -   Articles and tutorials on best practices for mobile app development for emerging markets.

### 3.4. Government & NGO Resources:
    -   Websites and publications from Indian government agricultural departments (national and state-level) for data on crop prices, agricultural schemes, and farmer demographics.
    -   Resources from NGOs and research institutions working on rural digital literacy and agricultural extension services.

## 4. Data to be Collected from Sources:

-   **User Needs:** Statistics on digital literacy, internet access, mobile usage patterns among Indian farmers; common pain points in accessing information and markets.
-   **Competitor Analysis:** Feature sets, UI/UX screenshots/descriptions, user reviews, pricing models, technology choices (if discernible), reported successes/failures.
-   **Technology:** Best practices for offline-first Android apps, data caching techniques, low-bandwidth optimization strategies, Supabase integration patterns, localization techniques.
-   **Challenges & Risks:** Common pitfalls in agri-tech MVP development, data acquisition strategies for market prices, user onboarding techniques for low-tech populations.
-   **Market Data:** Size and growth of the Indian agri-tech market, investment trends, government initiatives.

## 5. Citation and Referencing:

-   All information gathered, especially from external sources via Perplexity AI, will be documented with appropriate citations.
-   A comprehensive list of references will be compiled in the [`research/05_final_report/06_references.md`](research/05_final_report/06_references.md) document.
