# Information Sources

This document outlines the primary and secondary information sources that will be leveraged to answer the key research questions defined in `02_key_questions.md` and achieve the overall research objectives for creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) framework.

## 1. Primary Information Source: Perplexity AI

*   **Tool:** Perplexity AI (accessed via MCP Tool)
*   **Purpose:** To conduct targeted searches and gather detailed information on:
    *   Industry best practices for PRD structure and content.
    *   Commonly accepted sections and their typical contents.
    *   Effective requirements elicitation techniques.
    *   Characteristics of well-written requirements and user stories.
    *   Examples and templates of PRDs.
    *   Expert opinions and articles on product management and requirements engineering.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Formulate specific queries based on the key questions.
    *   Iteratively refine queries based on initial findings.
    *   Prioritize sources that provide actionable insights, templates, and established methodologies.
    *   Request and record citations for all significant pieces of information to ensure proper attribution and to build the `06_references.md` file in the final report.
    *   Utilize a low temperature setting for queries seeking factual information and established practices to ensure accuracy and relevance.
    *   Potentially use slightly higher temperature for brainstorming or exploring diverse perspectives on elicitation, if needed, while still prioritizing authoritative sources.

## 2. Secondary Information Sources: General Knowledge Domains

While Perplexity AI will be the active search tool, the interpretation and synthesis of information will also be informed by:

*   **Established Product Management Literature & Frameworks:** General knowledge of product management principles, including concepts from recognized books, blogs by industry leaders, and established frameworks (e.g., Agile methodologies, Lean principles as they relate to requirements).
*   **Software Engineering Best Practices:** Principles of software requirements specification, requirements engineering, and software development lifecycle models.
*   **UX/UI Design Principles:** Understanding how user experience considerations influence PRD content, particularly regarding user personas, user stories, and design specifications.

## 3. Information Validation and Synthesis

*   **Cross-Referencing:** Where possible, information obtained from Perplexity AI will be implicitly cross-referenced by seeking multiple sources or perspectives on key topics.
*   **Critical Evaluation:** All information will be evaluated for relevance, authority, and applicability to the research objectives.
*   **Synthesis:** The core activity will be to synthesize the gathered information into a coherent and actionable framework for PRD creation, documented in the subsequent research folders (`02_data_collection`, `03_analysis`, `04_synthesis`, `05_final_report`).

## 4. Documentation of Sources

*   All direct citations provided by Perplexity AI will be captured.
*   These citations will form the basis of the `research/05_final_report/06_references.md` document.
*   Key articles or particularly insightful sources may be noted in the `01_primary_findings.md` or `02_secondary_findings.md` as appropriate during the data collection phase.

By relying on Perplexity AI for targeted information retrieval and supplementing this with established knowledge domains, this research aims to produce a robust and well-founded set of recommendations for PRD development.
