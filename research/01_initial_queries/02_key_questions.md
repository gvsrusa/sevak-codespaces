# Key Research Questions: AgriConnect Feasibility Study & Market Analysis

This document outlines the key questions that will guide the research process for the AgriConnect feasibility study and market analysis. These questions are derived from the research scope and the AgriConnect PRD.

## 1. Target User Needs (Small and Marginal Indian Farmers)

### 1.1. Understanding User Context:
    -   What are the primary daily challenges faced by small and marginal Indian farmers regarding information access, market linkage, and agricultural practices?
    -   How does limited education and digital literacy specifically impact their ability to use mobile applications for agricultural purposes?
    -   What are the common patterns of mobile phone usage (device types, internet penetration, preferred apps) among this demographic?
    -   What are their current methods for obtaining market price information, crop advice, and transport services? What are the pain points in these current methods?

### 1.2. Needs Related to AgriConnect Features:
    -   **Marketplace & Pricing:**
        -   What information do farmers need to effectively list their produce for sale?
        -   How important is real-time local market price information for their selling decisions? What level of granularity (e.g., specific market, district level) is most useful?
        -   What are their expectations regarding finding local buyers through a mobile app?
    -   **Crop Advisory:**
        -   What are the most common and pressing issues (pests, diseases, weather impacts) for which farmers seek advice?
        -   What format of advisory content (text, images, audio, video snippets) would be most effective and accessible for low-literacy users?
        -   How can advisory content be tailored to specific local crops and conditions effectively?
    -   **Post-Harvest & Transport:**
        -   What are the major causes of post-harvest losses for these farmers?
        -   What kind of guidance on storage and handling is most needed?
        -   What are the current challenges in arranging transportation for produce to market? What information do they need to connect with transporters?

## 2. Competitive Landscape Analysis

### 2.1. General Market Overview:
    -   What is the current state of the agri-tech mobile app market in India targeting small farmers?
    -   What are the major trends, successes, and failures observed in this market?

### 2.2. Specific Competitor Analysis (BharatAgri, Cropin, KhetiBuddy, Farmonaut, Fasal, Hesa, GetFarms):
    -   For each competitor:
        -   What is their primary value proposition and target audience?
        -   What are their key features, particularly those related to marketplace, price discovery, crop advisory, and offline functionality?
        -   What are their reported strengths and weaknesses (based on user reviews, articles, etc.)?
        -   What is their business model (e.g., freemium, subscription, transaction-based)?
        -   How do they address issues like low digital literacy, local language support, and low-bandwidth environments?
        -   What can be learned from their UI/UX design choices?
    -   Are there any significant market gaps or underserved needs that AgriConnect could address?
    -   How do these competitors source and maintain information like market prices and advisory content?

## 3. Technological Considerations

### 3.1. Mobile Platform & Development:
    -   What are the best practices for developing Android-first applications for the Indian rural market?
    -   What specific UI/UX design principles should be adopted to ensure usability for users with low literacy and limited tech experience (e.g., icon-based navigation, voice assistance potential, clear visual hierarchy)?
    -   What are the most effective strategies for implementing robust offline functionality (caching data, offline data entry, synchronization mechanisms)?
    -   How can the app be optimized for performance in low-bandwidth and intermittent connectivity scenarios?

### 3.2. Language & Backend:
    -   What are the technical considerations and best practices for implementing multi-language support (focus on Hindi, Marathi, and potentially other key regional languages)?
    -   What are the specific advantages and potential challenges of using Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the backend for this type of application, particularly concerning scalability, data synchronization for offline use, and security?
    -   How can data be structured in Supabase to efficiently support the app's features (listings, prices, advisory content, user profiles)?

## 4. Key Challenges and Risks for MVP

### 4.1. Data & Content:
    -   What are reliable and sustainable methods for acquiring and updating real-time local market price data for various crops and regions?
    -   How can the accuracy, relevance, and timeliness of crop advisory and post-harvest guidance be ensured and maintained?
    -   What are the challenges in sourcing or creating high-quality advisory content in multiple local languages?

### 4.2. User Adoption & Engagement:
    -   What are the most effective strategies for onboarding and training low-tech users for an app like AgriConnect?
    -   How can trust be built with farmers, particularly regarding data privacy and the reliability of information provided?
    -   What are the potential barriers to adoption (e.g., cost of data, perceived complexity, lack of trust in digital solutions)?
    -   How can user feedback be effectively collected and incorporated for iterative improvement, especially from users with limited literacy?

### 4.3. Operational & Technical Risks:
    -   What are the primary technical risks associated with developing and deploying the MVP, especially concerning offline sync and low-bandwidth performance?
    -   What are the potential operational challenges in maintaining the app and its backend infrastructure?

## 5. Success Metrics Consideration

    -   How can the specific success criteria from PRD Section 8 (e.g., successful crop listing, accurate price viewing, accessible advisory) be quantitatively and qualitatively measured for the MVP?
    -   What leading indicators could suggest the app is meeting user needs and gaining traction?
    -   What are practical ways to gather data for these metrics, considering the target user base?
