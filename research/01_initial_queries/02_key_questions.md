# Key Research Questions

This document outlines the key questions that will guide the research process for understanding and structuring a Product Requirements Document (PRD). These questions are derived from the research objectives defined in `01_scope_definition.md`.

## 1. PRD Structure and Essential Components

*   What are the universally accepted or industry-standard sections of a comprehensive PRD?
*   Beyond standard sections, what optional or context-dependent sections are commonly included and for what types of projects or situations?
*   How detailed should each section typically be? (e.g., level of granularity for requirements, user stories)
*   What are common pitfalls or omissions in PRD structure and content?
*   Are there different structural models for PRDs (e.g., traditional vs. agile-friendly PRDs)? If so, what are their key characteristics and use cases?
*   What specific information should be included in sections like:
    *   Introduction/Overview
    *   Goals and Objectives (Product Goals, Business Goals, User Goals)
    *   Target Audience/User Personas
    *   User Stories and/or Use Cases
    *   Functional Requirements
    *   Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., performance, security, usability, scalability, accessibility)
    *   Design Considerations (e.g., links to wireframes, mockups, UI guidelines)
    *   Technical Specifications/Constraints
    *   Data Requirements
    *   Release Criteria/Acceptance Criteria
    *   Success Metrics/KPIs
    *   Assumptions and Dependencies
    *   Out of Scope/Future Considerations
    *   Glossary/Definitions

## 2. Best Practices for PRD Content

*   What defines a "good" requirement (e.g., clear, concise, unambiguous, testable, feasible, independent, necessary)?
*   What are best practices for writing user stories effectively?
*   How can a PRD maintain a balance between being comprehensive and being easily digestible/usable by different stakeholders (technical and non-technical)?
*   What role does visual information (diagrams, mockups) play in a PRD, and how should it be integrated?
*   How should version control and change management be handled for a PRD?
*   What are common mistakes made when writing PRD content, and how can they be avoided?

## 3. Requirements Elicitation Methodology

*   What are the most effective techniques for eliciting requirements from various stakeholders (e.g., business owners, users, technical teams)?
    *   Interviews (structured, unstructured)
    *   Surveys/Questionnaires
    *   Workshops (e.g., brainstorming, JAD sessions)
    *   User Observation/Shadowing
    *   Prototyping (as an elicitation tool)
    *   Document Analysis (of existing systems, market research)
    *   Competitive Analysis
*   How can these techniques be combined or sequenced for optimal results?
*   What specific questions or topic areas should be covered during requirements elicitation to ensure all necessary information for a PRD is captured? (This will form the basis for the proposed elicitation framework).
*   How can conflicting requirements from different stakeholders be identified and resolved?
*   What is the role of a product manager or business analyst in the elicitation process?
*   How can requirements be prioritized effectively?

## 4. PRD Outline for `docs/PRD.md`

*   Based on findings from questions 1 and 2, what is a recommended, detailed, Markdown-compatible table of contents/outline for the `docs/PRD.md` file?
*   How can this outline be structured to be flexible yet comprehensive?
*   What placeholders or prompts can be included in the outline to guide the eventual author of the PRD content?

These questions will serve as the foundation for formulating search queries for Perplexity AI and structuring the collected information.
