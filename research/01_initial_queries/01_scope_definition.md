# Research Scope Definition

## 1. Research Objective

The primary objective of this research is to provide comprehensive guidance for creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). This involves:

1.  **Identifying PRD Essentials:** Discovering industry best practices, common structural components, and essential sections that constitute a thorough and effective PRD.
2.  **Developing a Requirements Elicitation Framework:** Proposing a methodology, or a structured set of questions and topics, to systematically guide the process of gathering the necessary information to populate the PRD.
3.  **Recommending a PRD Outline:** Formulating a detailed table of contents or an outline specifically tailored for the `docs/PRD.md` file, which will serve as the project's PRD.

## 2. Context and Blueprint

This research is initiated based on the user's request to complete a PRD located at `docs/PRD.md`. The "blueprint" for this research is the user's original request:

> "The primary task is to complete the Product Requirements Document (PRD). The PRD file is located at `docs/PRD.md`. Please orchestrate the work required to bring this document to completion. This may involve assessing its current state, defining necessary sections if absent, writing content, and ensuring it comprehensively outlines the project requirements."

It is noted that the `docs/PRD.md` file is currently empty. The project for which the PRD is being created is not yet specified in detail, so the research will focus on general best practices applicable to a wide range of software projects.

## 3. Scope of Research

### In Scope:

*   **PRD Structure and Content:** Detailed investigation into standard and recommended sections of a PRD (e.g., Introduction, Goals, Target Audience, User Stories, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Design Mockups/Wireframes, Release Criteria, Success Metrics, Future Considerations).
*   **PRD Best Practices:** Identifying principles for writing clear, concise, unambiguous, and testable requirements.
*   **Requirements Elicitation Techniques:** Exploring methods such as stakeholder interviews, surveys, user observation, brainstorming, document analysis, and prototyping as they apply to gathering PRD content.
*   **Question/Topic Framework for Elicitation:** Developing a structured list of questions or discussion topics to facilitate comprehensive requirements gathering.
*   **PRD Outline/Table of Contents:** Creating a practical and detailed Markdown-compatible outline for `docs/PRD.md`.
*   **Information Sources:** Primarily leveraging Perplexity AI for data collection, supplemented by established product management and software engineering knowledge bases.

### Out of Scope:

*   **Project-Specific Requirements:** Eliciting or defining requirements for the actual, unspecified project. The research provides the *framework* for this, not the content itself.
*   **Writing the `docs/PRD.md` Content:** This research will deliver an outline and guidance, but not the final populated PRD content for the user's project.
*   **Tool Recommendations for PRD Management:** Beyond recommending Markdown for `docs/PRD.md`, this research will not delve into specific PRD software or platforms.
*   **Agile vs. Waterfall PRD Nuances in Depth:** While acknowledging different methodologies, the focus will be on core PRD elements broadly applicable, rather than an exhaustive comparison of PRDs in different development lifecycle models.

## 4. Deliverables from this Research Phase

The primary deliverable of this overall research project will be a populated `research` directory containing structured findings, culminating in a final report. This specific `01_scope_definition.md` file is the first step in the "Initialization and Scoping" phase.

## 5. Assumptions

*   The PRD is intended for a software development project.
*   The target audience for the PRD includes stakeholders such as product managers, designers, engineers, and QA testers.
*   The user has access to stakeholders or information sources from whom project-specific requirements can be elicited once the framework is provided.
