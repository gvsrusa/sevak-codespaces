# Research Scope Definition: AgriConnect Feasibility Study & Market Analysis

## 1. Research Goal

To conduct an initial feasibility study and market analysis for the AgriConnect mobile application. The research will focus on target user needs, existing similar solutions, potential technology choices (especially for offline functionality and low-bandwidth environments), and key challenges for an MVP. This study will be informed by the AgriConnect Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## 2. Key Areas of Investigation

The research will cover the following primary areas:

### 2.1. Target User Needs (Small and Marginal Indian Farmers)
    -   Detailed understanding of challenges faced by farmers with limited education, digital literacy, and internet access (as per PRD Section 2).
    -   Specific needs related to:
        -   Selling crops effectively (listing produce, finding buyers, fair pricing, market rates).
        -   Accessing expert agricultural advice (pests, diseases, weather impacts).
        -   Managing harvest and transport (storage, handling, connecting with transporters).

### 2.2. Competitive Landscape Analysis
    -   Analysis of existing similar solutions in the Indian agri-tech market.
    -   Specific focus on applications mentioned in PRD Section 9: BharatAgri, Cropin, KhetiBuddy, Farmonaut, Fasal, Hesa, GetFarms.
    -   Evaluation of their strengths, weaknesses, features, target audience, and business models relevant to AgriConnect's objectives.
    -   Identification of market gaps AgriConnect could fill.

### 2.3. Technological Considerations
    -   Appropriate technologies for an Android-first mobile application.
    -   Emphasis on:
        -   Offline functionality (PRD Section 5 & 6).
        -   Low-bandwidth performance.
        -   Local language support (Hindi, Marathi, etc. - PRD Section 7).
        -   Integration with Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the backend (PRD Section 7).
    -   Data caching strategies for offline use.
    -   User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles for low-literacy users (PRD Section 5).

### 2.4. Key Challenges and Risks for MVP
    -   Potential hurdles for Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development and adoption.
    -   Specific challenges including:
        -   Data acquisition and maintenance for real-time local market prices.
        -   User onboarding and training for low-tech users.
        -   Ensuring relevance and accuracy of crop advisory and post-harvest guidance.
        -   Building trust and ensuring data privacy (PRD Section 7).

### 2.5. Success Metrics Consideration
    -   Brief review of how the success criteria outlined in PRD Section 8 can be measured for the MVP.
    -   Focus on metrics related to:
        -   Crop listing success.
        -   Market price viewing accuracy and utility.
        -   Accessibility and usability of crop advisory content.

## 3. Out of Scope for Initial Research (MVP Focus)

Based on PRD Section 7 (Things to Avoid) and Section 10 (Future Dreams), the following are out of scope for this initial feasibility study:
    -   In-app transaction or payment processing.
    -   Complex AI features (image-based diagnosis, advanced analytics).
    -   Warehousing logistics or financing schemes integration.
    -   Full iOS version development details (beyond acknowledging Android-first).
    -   Detailed design of "Future Dreams" features like financial services, mechanization marketplace, etc.

## 4. Primary Information Source

-   AgriConnect Product Requirements Document ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)).
-   Perplexity AI for market research, competitor analysis, and technology investigation.
-   Publicly available information on competitor applications and agri-tech trends in India.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

A structured set of research documents organized within the `research` subdirectory, culminating in a final report summarizing findings, analysis, and recommendations. This will include:
    -   Initial Queries (Scope, Key Questions, Information Sources).
    -   Data Collection (Primary Findings, Secondary Findings, Expert Insights).
    -   Analysis (Patterns, Contradictions, Knowledge Gaps).
    -   Synthesis (Integrated Model, Key Insights, Practical Applications).
    -   Final Report (Executive Summary, Methodology, Detailed Findings, etc.).
